It is a dynamic website to transfer credits between users. It views the users' information in the database. There is a form in the USERS tab, in which when entries are entered, the credits are then transferred. 
For a successful transfer the users have to be listed in the database and the number of credits to be transferred should be less than or equal to the current credits of the user.
All successful transfers can be seen in the TRANSFERS tab.
